Lemmix is a recreation of the original Lemmings engine.  It was created by Eric Langedijk and later updated by ccexplore and namida to more closely match the behavior of the original DOS version of the game.  These players can be used to play through the original game levels, as well as the levels from other demos, expansions, and ports of the original game.

These players have not been updated since early 2017.  I have made some fixes and feature updates and released them here.  The version number is V29A instead of V30 to indicate that this is not an "official release".  I am making the changes available in this repository and it is up to namida and ccexplore to decide if they want to include any of them into the official codebase and build a new official V30 release.

If an official V30 release is made that does not include all of the changes that I have made, then I will merge in the code and build a V30A release with my updates added as well.
